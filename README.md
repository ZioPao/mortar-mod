[h1]Tutorial[/h1]
[olist]
[*] Find a mortar, some ammo, and a radio
[*] Place it wherever you want (maybe not inside a building, just saying)
[*] Right click on it and set a spotter (the other player must be in the same faction as yours!)
[*] Make sure the spotter has a radio and turn them on
[*] Select "Operate Mortar"
[*] Reload your round
[*] Shoot!
[/olist]

[h1]Notes[/h1]
The spotter will determine where the shot lands. Wherever the spotter is directed, the shot will land in a zone near in front of them.
